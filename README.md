# Nigeria Kidnapping, Killings, and Abductions Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze data on kidnappings, killings, and abductions in Nigeria from September 2021 to September 2022. By examining demographic information, regional patterns, and other factors, this analysis provides crucial insights into security trends across Nigeria.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
To identify trends and patterns in kidnapping, killings, and abduction incidents.
To provide demographic breakdowns (e.g., age, gender) of victims.
To highlight regional hotspots for these incidents.
To derive actionable insights that can help stakeholders enhance security measures.

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of compiled information on kidnapping, killing, and abduction incidents across Nigeria from September 2021 to September 2022. The dataset includes several important fields:
Date: The exact date when each incident occurred, allowing for analysis of temporal trends.
Location: The state and region where the incident took place, enabling geographic analysis to identify hotspots and patterns.
Incident Type: Classification of incidents into kidnapping, killing, or abduction, which helps to determine the frequency and severity of each type.
Demographics: Information about the victims, including gender and age, providing insights into the populations most affected by these incidents.

This data offers a foundation for understanding the dynamics and impact of insecurity across different parts of Nigeria.


## Tools and Technologies
The analysis was conducted using:
Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: To manipulate and analyze data.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook/VS Code: As the IDE for coding.

## Analysis & Results
The project focuses on:
- **Demographic Analysis**: Breakdown of victims based on gender and age.
- **Regional Hotspots**: Identification of states and regions with high rates of incidents.
- **Trends Over Time**: Monthly or quarterly trends to show how incidents have evolved.

### Key Findings
Hotspots: The analysis revealed that Kaduna, Zamfara, and Niger states consistently showed higher numbers of kidnapping, killing, and abduction incidents, making them major hotspots during the study period.
Victim Demographics: The data showed a higher number of male victims compared to female victims, with a particularly high frequency of incidents affecting individuals in the 18-45 age group. This suggests that young adults are particularly vulnerable.

Trends: A significant increase in incidents was observed between April and June 2022, likely coinciding with heightened activities of armed groups during that period. Conversely, a notable decline was seen from November 2021 to January 2022, possibly due to increased security measures during the festive season.

## Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations, such as:
Heatmaps for regional incident density.
Bar Charts for demographic distribution.
Line Graphs for trends over time.

## Usage
This analysis can be used by:
Security Agencies: To deploy resources more effectively.
Policy Makers: To understand areas needing intervention.
NGOs: To raise awareness and provide targeted support.

### How to Run the Project
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Fathiyah-Abba/Nigeria-Kidnapping-Analysis.git
2. Install Dependencies: This project requires Python and some specific packages. You can install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you are in the correct directory where the requirements.txt file is located.

3. Open the Notebook: If you are using Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory and open the analysis notebook:
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can simply open the .ipynb file in the editor.

4. Run the Code: Run the cells in sequence to execute the analysis. Ensure the dataset file is in the same directory as the notebook, or adjust the file path accordingly.

5. Results: The visualizations and analysis results will be generated as part of the notebook.
Make sure to configure your Python environment correctly, and install any additional dependencies as needed.
